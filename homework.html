    <h1>About my love to Berlin....</h1>
    <h2>Why I Love Berlin?Its a City That plays by its own Rules!</h2>
    <h3>As the saying goes: "Berlin is not Germany, Germany is not Berlin." This city definitely plays by its own rules, and below are seven times that Berlin has proved just that.</h3></center>
    <h2><em>Green city</em></h2>
    <p>Most big cities are known for their skyscrapers and concrete construction, but Berlin, as you may have guessed, doesn't follow the rule but is rather one of the very few exceptions. Sprawling parks and rooftop gardens give this city its unique natural look and feel.
        <ul><li>Berlin is, in fact, rated among the greenest cities in Europe.
        </li></ul>
    </p>
    <h2><em>Casual Friday, everyday</em></h2>
    <p>Maybe it's the fact that Berlin is basically run by startups and therefore the casual Mark Zuckerberg-esque CEO types, but suits are pretty rare in the capital.Normally in Germany, the business world takes a more serious approach to work with proper business attire (i.e. suit and tie) being a "must". Business men and women in Berlin on the other hand, can often be found strolling around Kreuzberg in tattered Chuck Taylors and skinny jeans.
        <ul><li>You need to feel you comfortable.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <h2><em>You don't need to speak German</em></h2>
    <p>As many tourists and expats know, you don't have to speak German to get around. Berlin is a veritable melting pot of cultures and languages, and a huge influx of international business and immigration of young minds from all corners of the earth means that, unfortunately, the German language gets a little lost in translation.<ul><li>The city offering everything, from menus to jobs, exclusively in English.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <h2><em>Better late than never</em></h2>
    <p>It's a fact, Germans are pretty punctual, but Berliners in general are less worried about punctuality and are sometimes even…(gasp!)….late. </p>
    <h2><em>Ice Cream all-year round</em></h2>
    <p>Whether it's January or July, ice cream shops are open all over the city. Berlin loves its ice cream, and a little outside chill is definitely not going to going to stop that.</p>
    <h2><em>All-night public transport</em></h2>
    <p> In Berlin, the public transportation (i.e. trains and metro) run 24 hours over the weekend, happily transporting eager partygoers and late-night drinkers across the city.
        <ul><li>city,  that truly never goes to sleep.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <h2><em>Vegan inclusion</em></h2>
    <p>Who says the beloved döner can only be enjoyed by meat lovers? Vöner offers vegans and vegetarians another option. Their döners, burgers and currywurstare 100% meat-free and vegan.</p>
